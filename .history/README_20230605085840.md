# Wind Turbine Power Prediction

This project predicts wind turbine power output based on several environmental variables: wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. It applies multiple machine learning models to the problem, trains them on the data, and combines their outputs using a voting regressor to generate predictions.

## Method

First, data is generated using the Weibull distribution for wind speed, a uniform distribution for wind direction (from 0 to 360 degrees), and a normal distribution for temperature. This data is then preprocessed using a custom DataProcessor class that scales the wind speed, wind direction, and temperature.

The machine learning models used in this project include a linear regression, a Gaussian process regressor, a multi-layer perceptron regressor, and a support vector regressor. These models are trained on the preprocessed data, and their outputs are combined using a voting regressor to create the final predictions.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following command:

## Generating Data

To generate wind turbine data, use the `generate_data` command:

\```bash
python -m wind_turbine_power.cli generate_data --size 1000 --cut_in 3.5 --rated_speed 15 --rated_power 25 --cut_out 25 --shape 2 --scale 2 --random_seed 42 --out_path ./data/raw/wind_turbine_data.csv
\```

## Training the Model

To train the prediction model, use the `train_model` command:

```bash
python -m wind_turbine_power.cli train_model --data_path ./data/raw/wind_turbine_data.csv --model_path ./data/processed/wind_turbine_model.pkl
```

## Making Predictions

To predict power output for given wind speed, wind direction, and temperature, use the `predict` command:

\```bash
python -m wind_turbine_power.cli predict --model_path ./data/processed/wind_turbine_model.pkl 24.5872 0 20
\```

Please note that the wind speed should be in m/s, the wind direction in degrees from 0 to 360, and the temperature in Celsius.

## Future Work

This project can be extended to include more environmental factors that affect wind turbine output. Moreover, more complex machine learning models can be employed to improve prediction accuracy.
