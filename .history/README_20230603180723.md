# Wind Turbine Power Prediction

This project predicts wind turbine power output based on several environmental variables: wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. It applies multiple machine learning models to the problem, trains them on the data, and combines their outputs using a voting regressor to generate predictions.

## Method

First, data is generated using the Weibull distribution for wind speed and a normal distribution for temperature, while wind direction is evenly distributed across all angles. This data is then preprocessed using a custom DataProcessor class that scales the wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. 

The machine learning models used in this project include a linear regression, a Gaussian process regressor, a multi-layer perceptron regressor, and a support vector regressor. These models are trained on the preprocessed data and their outputs are combined using a voting regressor to create the final predictions.
