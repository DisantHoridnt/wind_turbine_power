# Wind Turbine Power Prediction

This project predicts wind turbine power output based on several environmental variables: wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. It applies multiple machine learning models to the problem, trains them on the data, and combines their outputs using a voting regressor to generate predictions.

## Method

First, data is generated using the Weibull distribution for wind speed and a normal distribution for temperature, while wind direction is evenly distributed across all angles. This data is then preprocessed using a custom DataProcessor class that scales the wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. 

The machine learning models used in this project include a linear regression, a Gaussian process regressor, a multi-layer perceptron regressor, and a support vector regressor. These models are trained on the preprocessed data and their outputs are combined using a voting regressor to create the final predictions.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following command:

Generating Data

To generate wind turbine data, use the generate_data command:

bash
Copy code
python -m wind_turbine_power.cli generate_data --size 1000 --min_speed 3 --max_speed 15 --std_dev 2 --power_coeff 0.5 --out_path ./data/raw/wind_turbine_data.csv

## Training the Model

To train the prediction model, use the train_model command:

```bash
python -m wind_turbine_power.cli train_model --data_path ./data/raw/wind_turbine_data.csv --model_path ./data/processed/wind_turbine_model.pkl
```

## Making Predictions

To predict power output for given wind speed, wind direction, and temperature, use the predict command:

```bash
python -m wind_turbine_power.cli predict --model_path ./data/processed/wind_turbine_model.pkl --wind_speed 10 --wind_direction 45 --temperature 15
```
Please note that the wind speed should be in m/s, the wind direction in degrees from 0 to 360, and the temperature in Celsius.

## Future Work

This project can be extended to include more environmental factors that affect wind turbine output. Moreover, more complex machine learning models can be employed to improve prediction accuracy.
